1. NGordnet (Ngrams): browser based tool for exploring the history of word usage and their hyponyms in English texts 

Created a backend accepting multi-word inputs and constructed a graph based on hyponyms as noted from the Google Ngrams dataset. 
Used BFS to traverse graph and output hyponyms in highest to lowest usage during the given time period.
